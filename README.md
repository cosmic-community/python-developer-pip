### Content Model Prompt

> "Create a content model for a Python developer portfolio with:
- Projects (title, description, tech stack, github link)
- Skills (name, proficiency level, category)
- About section (bio, experience)

This will showcase Python web development capabilities."

### Code Generation Prompt

> Based on the content model I created, now build a complete Python web application that showcases this content using pip. 

Create a FastAPI application with:
- Modern, responsive design with proper navigation
- Content display from Cosmic CMS
- API endpoints for content retrieval
- Production-ready deployment configuration for Vercel
- Proper error handling and performance optimization

Use pip for all dependency management.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

```python
from cosmicpy import CosmicPy

cosmic = CosmicPy()
bucket = cosmic.bucket(
    bucket_slug='your-bucket-slug',

# Get all projects
projects = bucket.get_objects(type='projects')

# Get a specific project by slug
project = bucket.get_object(slug='project-slug', type='projects')
```

### Fetching Skills by Category
```python
# Get all skills
skills = bucket.get_objects(type='skills')

# Filter skills by category (done in application logic)
programming_skills = [
